Hi everyone! I’m Nhat-Minh, a PhD student in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Lihua Xie](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=Fmrv3J8AAAAJ&hl=en). 

I hold both undergraduate and master’s degrees in Control and Automation Engineering from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), graduating valedictorian and earning a perfect grade for my Master’s thesis. During my studies, I had the privilege of working under the guidance of Prof. Phuoc Doan Nguyen (Master’s thesis), Assoc. Prof. Nga Thi-Thuy Vu (undergraduate thesis), and have collaborated closely with [Dr. Minh Hoang Trinh](https://sites.google.com/view/minhhoangtrinh). 

Since 2024, I have also been serving as a researcher and faculty member in the Department of Automation Engineering at HUST. Prior to that, I worked for two years as a guidance and control engineer at the [Viettel Aerospace Institute](https://viettelaerospace.vn/). 

My research interests include networked control, learning-based control, missile guidance algorithms, and probabilistic approach to control problems. **Please feel free to reach out if you're interested in potential research collaborations!**


## Research

**Networked control:** Develop consensus algorithms for random graphs with multidimensional interactions (matrix-weighted graphs) and create novel algorithms for formation control, network localization, and distributed operational research, grounded in control theory.

**Learning-based control:** Develop innovative reinforcement learning-based control algorithms for various systems, including renewable energy systems, robotic systems, and aerial vehicles.

**Missile guidance:** Impact time control guidance, Impact angle control guidance and cooperative missile guidance.

**Probabilistic approach to control problems:** Explore gossip-type algorithms and their variations for applications in multi-agent systems, focusing on efficient information exchange, decentralized consensus, and coordination.


## Awards and Honors

* **Viettel excellence scholarship (2024)** Full Master's Scholarship awarded in recognition of outstanding academic achievement as a master's student.
* **Student Scientific Research (2022)** Received the third prize for the topic: Application of near-infrared spectral and machine learning.
