Hi everyone! Nhat-Minh here. I’m a researcher and faculty member in the Department of Automation Engineering at the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST). I hold both undergraduate and master’s degrees from HUST, graduating summa cum laude and earning a perfect grade for my Master’s thesis. I had the privilege of working under the supervision of Prof. Phuoc Doan Nguyen for my Master’s thesis, Assoc. Prof. Nga Thi-Thuy Vu for my undergraduate thesis, and I also work closely with [Dr. Minh Hoang Trinh](https://sites.google.com/view/minhhoangtrinh). Before joining HUST, I spent two years as a guidance and control engineer at [Viettel Aerospace Institute](https://viettelaerospace.vn/). My research interests include networked control, learning-based control, missile guidance algorithms, and probabilistic approach to control problems. **Please feel free to reach out if you're interested in potential research collaborations!**


**Important!!! I'm looking for an open PhD position.**


## Research

**Networked control:** Develop consensus algorithms for random graphs with multidimensional interactions (matrix-weighted graphs) and create novel algorithms for formation control, network localization, and distributed operational research, grounded in control theory.

**Learning-based control:** Develop innovative reinforcement learning-based control algorithms for various systems, including renewable energy systems, robotic systems, and aerial vehicles.

**Missile guidance:** Impact time control guidance, Impact angle control guidance and cooperative missile guidance.

**Probabilistic approach to control problems:** Explore gossip-type algorithms and their variations for applications in multi-agent systems, focusing on efficient information exchange, decentralized consensus, and coordination.


## Awards and Honors

* **Viettel excellence scholarship (2024)** Full Master's Scholarship awarded in recognition of outstanding academic achievement as a master's student.
* **Student Scientific Research (2022)** Received the third prize for the topic: Application of near-infrared spectral and machine learning.
